# ICFSR2019
Code for ICFSR 2019 presentation

It is a demonstration of the codes for ICFSR 2019 presentation.

Hypermethylation value of gene promoters is used as dependent variable.
Age, BMI, nutrients are used as independent variables. 
Physical activity is treated in two ways: 1) being analyzed as a whole score (PASE); 2) being separated into subcategories.

Cross-validation is used 1) to evaluate reliability of folds; 2) for hyperparameter tuning in lasso regression.

Nutrient intakes can also be treated and analyzed in other ways such as being normalized for body mass or 
being categorized by recommended daily intake.
Yet these analyses are beyond this code demonstration.
